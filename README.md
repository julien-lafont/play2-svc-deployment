# Automatic updater for Play2 projects

> Works only with Play2 apps builded on **Jenkins** and managed by **svc**. In other world, yes, it will only works for Zenexity app ;)

**USE WITH CAUTION!**


## Pre-requisites
* Play2 project
* Builded on Jenkin with this configuration


    /home/builder/play/2.1.0/play play-version;
    /home/builder/play/2.1.0/play clean dist;
    cd dist
    mv *.zip myapp-release.zip


## Why this tool ?

Because I'm a very lazy developer, and I have to do the same task more than 3 times...
